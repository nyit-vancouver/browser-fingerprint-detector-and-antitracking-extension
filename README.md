# Browser Fingerprint Detection and Anti-Tracking
Digital fingerprints have brought great convenience and benefits to many online businesses. However, they pose a significant threat to the privacy and security of ordinary users. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of current anti-tracking methods against digital fingerprints and design a browser extension that can effectively resist digital fingerprints and record the website's collection of digital fingerprint-related information.
